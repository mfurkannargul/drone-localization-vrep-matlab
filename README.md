# Simulation of Drone Localization Through Circle Detection and LS (Least Square) & Trilateration Algorithms on V-Rep Pro via MATLAB Scripts

Hello everyone!

In the repository, I'll explain you how to do "Simulation of Drone Localization Through Circe Detection and LS (Least Square) & Trilateration Algorithms" on V-Rep Pro via MATLAB scripts. It's the first part of our Senior Design (Capstone) Project as a team in the scope of Electrical & Electronics Engineering department of Abdullah GÃ¼l University.
